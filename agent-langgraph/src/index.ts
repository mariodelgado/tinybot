/**
 * The same Bot, on a framework.

 * keeping the same AG-UI endpoint contract.
 *
 * A Bot is a registry row pointing at an AG-UI endpoint, so adding a framework does not require
 * server changes.
 *
 * The model API stops being ours. `agent-bot` speaks `/v1/chat/completions` by hand, which is why
 * gpt-5.6 cannot be used there without rewriting its streaming loop: those models reject function
 * tools on that endpoint and require the Responses API. Here it is `useResponsesApi`, one line,
 * because the migration belongs to the people who maintain the integration.
 *
 * The tool loop still runs on the client, exactly as it does in `agent-bot`: a Bot's actions happen
 * on a browser the person is watching, and the surface remains the place that executes those tools.
 * The graph provides model orchestration without changing that contract.

 * translation. Here it is a name and a key, because the integrations already exist and are
