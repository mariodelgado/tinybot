# Architecture

OpenBot combines a React app, a Hono API server, PostgreSQL, CopilotKit Intelligence, AG-UI Bot endpoints, and governed browser computers.

  <img src="../assets/architecture-light.svg" alt="A turn goes from the app to the server, which sends it to a Bot over AG-UI. Every tool call the Bot makes returns through the gateway, which resolves the target, decides it against the configured policy, records an audit row, and only then acts, or refuses and names the rule. Allowed actions reach that Bot's own computer, one container each holding its own Chromium, logins and workspace, created by the supervisor. Every decision lands in PostgreSQL; threads and memory live in CopilotKit Intelligence.">

| `agent-computer`         | 4100                       | Chromium, `/workspace`, browser profile, screenshots, snapshots, and file tools.                                                            |
| `agent-bot`              | 4200                       | Proof-of-concept AG-UI Bot.                                                                                                                     |
| `agent-langgraph`        | 4201                       | LangGraph AG-UI Bot.                                                                                                                        |
| `supervisor`             | 4500 host / 4300 container | Creates, stops, resets, and lists per-Bot computer containers.                                                                              |
| PostgreSQL with pgvector | 5432                       | Product data, audit rows, credentials, policy, grants, channels, components, connector state, and knowledge records.                        |
| CopilotKit Intelligence  | external                   | Durable threads, memory, and realtime gateway.                                                                                              |
| TinyPipe                 | 3712                       | TinyFish auth + metering (platform-capability primitive). Start-page card after TinyPrior. `/ui` is the console; `/mcp` is the fixture-desk socket; `GET /health` is the probe. TinyBot agents call `POST /api/products/tinypipe/mcp`. |
| TinyTail / TinyWeb / TinyKit | 18765 / 18766 / 18083 | Platform-capability primitives (`kind: "platform"`). Start-page cards and empty-state agents after TinyPipe (which follows TinyPrior). |
| TinyPing + 10 board products | 18101, 18081, 18102–18105, 18082, 18106–18109 | Board primitives on the start page and empty-state roster (TinyPing first). Cards iframe the UI; agents use `/api/products/<slug>/*`. |

`scripts/start.sh` starts TinyPipe first, then the other TinyFish products (`docker-compose.tinyfish.yml` lists all 15 as git-context fallback, or a wrap of each product's latest compose), then PostgreSQL, `agent-computer`, `agent-bot`, `agent-langgraph`, and the supervisor through Docker Compose, then starts `server` and `app` on the host. Product source is fetched as a linked service (sibling or `.tinyfish-siblings/`), never vendored. README-only board repos are not a start failure.

Without a Sprite, TinyBot consumes each product at `/api/products/<slug>/*` → `127.0.0.1:<hostPort>` or `TINYFISH_<SLUG>_URL` / `VITE_TINYFISH_<USAGE>_URL` (Fly) with the signed-in TinyFish Bearer. Sprite path stays `/api/sprite/apps/<slug>/*`. See [TINYBOT.md](../TINYBOT.md).

With `SPRITES_TOKEN` / `SPRITE_TOKEN`, TinyBot is the shared control plane and each TinyFish user gets one Fly Sprite. The Sprite URL is token-gated (`auth: sprite`). Inside the Sprite, Caddy is the only `http_port` (8080) and reverse-proxies `/tinypipe`, `/tinyping`, … to the product listen ports. TinyBot's session proxy (`/api/sprite/apps/<slug>`) is the only browser path to that URL. Local compose is unchanged when the token is unset. CI never calls `api.sprites.dev`.

The compose file also defines optional SPIRE services. `start.sh` does not start them.

## Runtime flow

1. The app opens a channel or direct Bot session.
2. The server resolves the signed-in actor and selected coworker.
3. CopilotKit runtime sends the turn to the configured AG-UI endpoint.
4. The surface registers available frontend tools: browser tools, MCP tools, and components granted to that Bot.
5. Acting browser/file/MCP calls return to the server for authorization and audit.
6. The server streams results back to the app and Intelligence thread.

## Browser action governance

The computer itself does not decide policy. The server gateway is the action boundary:

1. resolve the target from the server-held snapshot or request subject;
2. evaluate the current action policy;
3. write an audit row for the decision;
4. call the computer only when the decision forwards;
5. write a second audit row if a forwarded action fails.

Policy rules can inspect:

- `tool.name`
- `intent`
- `bot.id`
- `actor.id`
- `page.url`, `page.host`
- `element.ref`, `element.role`, `element.name`, `element.type`
- `key`
- `file.path`, `file.name`, `file.extension`
- `mcp.server`, `mcp.tool`, `mcp.effect`

Rules use CEL expressions plus case-insensitive `contains()` and `matches()`.
Deny rules are evaluated before allow rules. The policy engine fails closed: a
missing or empty policy permits nothing, a broken deny rule denies, and a broken
allow rule does not permit. OpenBot's shipped startup default is explicit:
`deny: []` and `allow: ["true"]`, unless `AGENT_COMPUTER_POLICY` or a saved
administrator policy replaces it. A malformed configured policy stops server
startup.

## Computers

`agent-computer` requires `COMPUTER_TOKEN` and permits only `/health` without it. Docker Compose binds it to `127.0.0.1:4100`.

With `COMPUTER_SUPERVISOR_URL`, each Bot gets its own computer container, workspace volume, and browser profile. Without it, all Bots share `AGENT_COMPUTER_URL`.

The supervisor exposes only ensure, stop, reset, and list operations. It holds the Docker socket, so do not expose it outside the deployment network. Set `COMPUTER_RUNTIME=runsc` to run computers under gVisor on hosts that support it.

## Human control and secrets

Handovers are audited as control events:

- `computer.help_requested`
- `computer.control_taken`
- `computer.control_released`

While a person controls the browser, Bot actions are refused rather than queued.

Secret entry is separate from chat content. The audit trail records that a secret was requested or supplied and the character count, not the secret value.

## Coworkers and channels

A coworker is a durable Bot profile:

- `agents` stores runtime identity and endpoint/key reference.
- `agent_profiles` stores name, title, role, owner, visibility, and deletion state.
- `agent_preferences` stores per-user roster state.

A channel is a conversation with one coworker and a CopilotKit Intelligence thread mapping. Starting a new channel creates a new thread.

See [coworkers.md](coworkers.md).

## Components

Components are frontend tools a Bot can call instead of answering only in prose.

Sources:

- compiled React components in `app/src/components/gallery/`;
- sandboxed components authored and published from `/admin/playground`.

Governance:

- compiled components are published when first seen by the app catalogue sync;
- sandboxed components are saved as drafts and become usable only after publish;
- every call asks the server whether the component exists, is published, and is not withheld from the Bot;
- component data functions require a separate per-component grant.

The shipped component data functions read the audit trail: `botActivity` and `recentRefusals`.

## MCP and skills

MCP servers and skills share the plugin grant table, but they have different ownership rules.

- MCP tools are admin-governed because they can reach external systems with stored credentials.
- Skills are reusable instructions. A person can create personal skills and attach them only to Bots they own. Administrators create deployment skills.

The curated MCP catalogue contains Atlassian, Box, Slack, Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Custom MCP servers must pass URL checks; unknown tools and custom-server tools are treated as writes unless positively classified as reads.

Every MCP call checks the grant first, then evaluates the same action policy engine with MCP context, then audits the result.

## Tenant package and knowledge

`TENANT_PACKAGE_DIR` points at the tenant package. The default is `../examples/fintech`.

Required package files:

- `brand.yaml`
- `agents.yaml`
- `channels.yaml`
- `model.yaml`
- `knowledge.yaml`

The server validates the package at startup. Channel agent IDs must match declared agents. Knowledge sources currently support Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive declarations.

Connector credentials are stored through the credential vault and referenced by id, not stored inline in YAML.

## Security boundaries

- Server routes enforce auth and roles; admin pages are backed by server-side administrator checks.
- `OPENBOT_DEV_NO_AUTH=true` is local-only and is refused with `NODE_ENV=production`.
- `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be a base64-encoded 32-byte value. The example key is refused with `NODE_ENV=production`.
- Credential plaintext is encrypted at rest, never returned by APIs, and redacted from audit events.
- Browser navigation allows `http` and `https`; cloud metadata addresses are refused under every configuration.
- `AGENT_COMPUTER_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS=true` is for local development only.
- Computer tokens and supervisor tokens must be long random values outside local development.
